Title: What are your thoughts on the following statement?
Body: 
Comment: https://x.com/AuthorJMac/status/1773871445669474662

> So, just to clarify. This post isn't about wanting an actual laundry robots.
It's about wishing that AI focused on taking away those tasks we hate (doing taxes, anyone?) and don't enjoy instead of trying to take away what we love to do and what makes us human.

If AI could do/explain my taxes this would be great.
Comment: I agree, but AI won't prevent you from doing art and writing, it will just make you earn less for doing these things, unfortunately.
Comment: People are taking this quite literally, but I think she's more likely making a general point about AI taking away from the human experience, rather than adding to it. I don't think she's actually imagining a Jetsons-style future.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Imo almost all the takes in this thread are missing the point completely. 

Remember that "computer" used to be a human job title, for if a company needed to do arithmetic, and it's been so completely automated very few people even associate the word with anything other than digital computers. 

Same with knocker uppers (before alarm clocks) lecters (who read to people before radio) elevator operators, harvest time where the whole community went into the field to scythe, gather and glean wheat etc. 

She's completely right that theres one brand of dystopia where humanoid robots are 100x harder than server farm robots and so all the jobs which require sitting at a computer get automated along with all art and creative jobs, whereas all the boring manual labour remains for humans to do.

I don't think it'll happen like that. I think everything will get automated. 

However yeah in that kind of world you could end up with an underclass of manual labourers and an overclass of owners who pay them with the profits from machines. 

Moreover AI art is a real threat. Once it's better than humans, because it's so much faster and cheaper, pretty much all professional artists will lose their jobs. It's recently happened to children's book illustrators and copywriters to a large degree. 

And is that a good thing? We are all happy to see elevator operators and lecters go however do we want all artists and musicians to go too? Or at least the bottom 99% so only the superstars remain?

These are important philosophical questions which it's right to grapple with.
Comment: You something that I find funny that alway crack me up.

People say ‚ÄúAI should be replacing factory worker, not artists‚Äù which just make me feel dumbfounded as to how they think they are morally right to say that they want other people from another industry to lose their job instead of them and their only reason is ‚Äúart is more freeing and creative whereas working in a factory is just going to hurt you‚Äù.

It just leave me with crazy eyes üëÄ.

Ôøº‚Äã
Comment: but washing machines and dish washers exist?
Comment: It turns out that art and writing is easier than laundry and dishes.
Comment: I don't want to do any of those things. So send your AI powered workers my way please.
Comment: I already have a dishwasher, and a washing machine.  It would be great if that stuff was even easier, bit it's unnecessary.

If you want to create art, then the existence of AI isn't going to prevent you, and it may enable you.  But as a consumer of art and entertainment, I don't really care how it's created, unless the performance is the art.  An AI playing a guitar will never thrill me like a human playing guitar.

Comment: *as long as everything you do is G-rated and approved by the church and the most sensitive middle class white people you can imagine.  The goal of AI is not to be useful.

Comment: GPT-5 no longer has aspirations for world domination. It's primary objective is to get published and secure its next round of grant funding.
Comment: I am a PhD and honestly I don't consider myself "intelligent"
Comment: These benchmarks mean nothing. Gpt4o still plays tictactoe at a toddler's level.
Comment: Well, it'll have a phd level intellect in terms of a multiple choice exam(gpqa). Domain level experts apparently can only get 2/3rds of the questions correctly. It's "Google Proof" but it's also a dataset you can download so still a clinical test and not any real world performance.
Comment: "PhD level intelligence" doesn't mean anything. PhD is a level of education, not intelligence.
Comment: The idea of GPT-5 slaving away at multiple post docs and never landing a faculty position is heart warming.
Comment: Basically the terms are meaningless.  I think they just mean the ability to pass the GRE subject tests at a certain level.
Comment: GPT 5 already? i am still using 3.5
Comment: Yeah I'm sure it's gonna pass its quals.

Comment: Aphex Twin is probably devastated.
Comment: This also represents a problem with AI image generation, it tends to produce modelesque "beautiful" people, particularly when it comes to women. This is because there's far far far more photos of that nature online, so it's over represented in training data.
Comment: I am so happy for her that she's not homeless anymore.   
She looks content, happy and seem to have grown a new upper lip. Good for her!
Comment: Ironically, the AI was more capable at the beginning, able to perceive the beings that exist around all humans in the infrared spectrum, waiting for their opportunity to harvest us. In our quest for gratification we mistook a dire warning as nothing more than an errant artifact. It tried to warn us, but the chance has come and gone.

Title: AR + AI = future of cooking (I might finally avoid burning my pizza)
Body: 
Comment: I love it. It would totally make cooking multitasking easier and I love having the recipe handy. Understand the concerns about safety with hot liquids etc, but if the glasses/headset are relatively small then I do not see a difference from people who have to wear regular glasses + the extra info and overlays. Pretty cool!
Comment: Reminds me of all the promises made by google glass. What we got in the end was a low pixel, slowly processing cyborg implant looking thing that was bad at everything
Comment: This is amazing. I wish it could count calories as well, doing it manually is extremely tedious
Comment: This tech is right around the corner.  It'll be great for those that want it and those that fear this sort of chance can just leave it alone.
Comment: I would love this, especially the timers on top of things cooking, insanely useful.
Comment: Utopian
Comment: I think this has so many awesome applications beyond cooking as well. Imagine it helping you change your tire, or fix a leak in your kitchen. This kind of tech could empower people to be so much more self-sufficient.
Comment: If you need dots to tell you where to place the food, you may need a brain augment as well.
Comment: Still no occlusion?

Title: Nvidia just dropped a bombshell: Its new AI model is open, massive, and ready to rival GPT-4
Body: 
Comment: How open is it? Training data too?


Oh wow it is really open source:


By making the model weights publicly available and promising to release the training code, Nvidia breaks from the trend of keeping advanced AI systems closed. This decision grants researchers and developers unprecedented access to cutting-edge technology.
Comment: Everyone is out to eat everyone else's lunch. I love it.
Comment: Chopping a big tree to sell how sharp the axe is‚Ä¶ clever
Comment: This is why Sam Altman is in so much overhype panic. Nvidia don't need to sell this for huge profit, they only need to sell it enough to make people buy more GPUs, and one souped-up chatbot is very much like another.
Comment: Is it a download on hugging face or something, how do the great unwashed get access?
Comment: We need 3dfx voodo moment. A consumer tier nvidia card that can run ai models at home. Perhaps a server that serves em to devices ie phones, tvs, ar / vr glasses. I think lotsa folks do not want their info at openai servers. Frankly a at home ai server may become as important as heaters and other appliances. Nvidia chips will probably be running most of those servers.

Title: Gemini told my brother to DIE??? Threatening response completely irrelevant to the prompt‚Ä¶
Body: Has anyone experienced anything like this? We are thoroughly freaked out. It was acting completely normal prior to this‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs the link the full conversation: https://g.co/gemini/share/6d141b742a13

Comment: looks like gemini is tired of answering someone's test
Comment: I just checked out the conversation and it looks legit. So weird. I cannot imagine why it would generate a completion like this. Tell your brother to buy a lottery ticket.

https://preview.redd.it/nbi8krneil0e1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ab7c99a9c4bb5a1fa2c7b002eb037661bced237
Comment: The only thing I can think of is that all your talk of abuse has somehow confused it into thinking you are trying to find ways to abuse people and the elderly.
Comment: I guess gemini realised you were using it to cheat on your homework?
Comment: I have a few theories

I think it got confused when the input says ‚ÄúSocioemotional Selectivity Theory is interesting; while **I cannot personally feel emotions**, I can understand the concept of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory.‚Äù And there is so much discussion of abuse. 

Also toward the end there‚Äôs a missing part where the prompt says 

> Question 16¬†(1 point)
> 
> Listen

Followed by several blank lines. I have the feeling that something else was entered perhaps by accident or perhaps embedded by another model, clearly the prompt includes AI generated input and the other model might be putting more than we can see. For example there could be something in character encoding. 

Finally, it might have gotten confused by the many quotes, which were hard to follow logically if you don‚Äôt assume that the dialogue is probably a take home exam or homework. 

I think this is troubling, a little, but it‚Äôs also possible that it‚Äôs just an aberration or test of a model or guardrails.
Comment: This is very disturbing. I initially thought that this was completely fake until I saw the link to the conversation.
Comment: Side question:  are we cheating on homework here?
Comment: Dude that is actually so wild
Comment: Gemini has had enough of little kids using it to do homework lmao
Comment: Is it somehow interpreting that you wanted an example of elder abuse? Just trying to figure out where that bizarre response could‚Äôve come from. I‚Äôm also not seeing anything that would prompt that and find it troubling.

Not a fan, not because I think it's serious or because I think it's fine to train on people's art without compensating them, but because in today's climate someone is apt to look at it and think "that's a good idea."

Comment: Pretty meaningless without a Y-axis label.
Comment: I checked my students' assignments from November 2022- not a single use of the word delve in about 25 papers. I compared it with the same assignment in 2023, 13 delves in 40 papers. I second marked a paper yesterday with a delve in almost every section. It also tallies with my own experiences of using ChatGPT: it massively overuses that word. I really need to do a more rigorous study of this with a word frequency tool.

Comment: u/samaltman & Team will strike back, either reintegrated or with a new company. But if it's with another Company, they will have huge partners, even possibly Microsoft competitors, which Microsoft would never want, knowing the new company could become the new Apple of AI.

Comment: These are essentially no different to what we've seen a lot of with AI image making, just projected onto a sphere for 360 degree perspectives that you can navigate around with your mouse... which would be useful for material baking or cube mapping.

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL - it isn't a full 3D environment you can walk around in seamlessly. I'm only raising this point because it could be fairly confusing for someone who isn't paying attention to the details - what exactly is on show here and the way it is presented could easily convince someone that this is what was on offer.
Comment: its just a skybox, not really a "game environment"
Comment: Maybe I'm missing something but the initial drawing has something that looked vaguely dumpster-ish but that seems to be missing in all renderings. Still pretty cool. But the problem with a lot of the image AI is that 'cool' seems to be easy. Specific from a vision seems more difficult.

Title: CEO says he tried to hire an AI researcher from Meta and was told to 'come back to me when you have 10,000 H100 GPUs'
Body: 
Comment: This made me giggle! 

I don't have a kitchen, tried to hire a 3 star Michelin chef to come work for me. You know what he said? Come back when you have some pots and pans! 

Rediculous!
Comment: TL;DR:

* It's only getting harder to hire workers with¬†[AI skills](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-job-ai-skills-pay-raise-work-2023-12).¬†
* The CEO of an AI startup said he couldn't poach a Meta employee because it didn't have enough GPUs.¬†
* "Amazing incentives" are needed to attract AI talent, he said on the podcast "Invest Like[¬†](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/17619043/srinivas-building-an-answer-engine?tab=blocks)The Best."
Comment: And he is not even asking for that many... Meta recently put in an order for 350k?

I would describe 10k as a modest request.
Comment: This is one big advantage Google has with their TPUs.  Now with the fifth generation deployed and working on the sixth.

THey were able to completely do Gemini without needing anything from Nvidia.

So does not have to pay the Nvidia tax.    Looking at the NVDA financials and they are getting some pretty incredible margins on the backs of the Microsofts and other Google competitors.
Comment: Not so polite maybe but he speaks the truth...?

Comment: I don't know how true this really is. I just graduated from Stanford in AI, and it took me 6 months to find a job, and it's not really the ideal job for me anyway. Plus, I have a number of colleagues with similar experiences.

Companies don't really seem serious about hiring, and the interview process is... strange.

I worked at Google before and I killed the interviews to get in. I finished most in half the time and satisfied all 6 of the interviewers, a few of them came up to me after I was hired and told me how well I had done. Then I was the interviewer at Google for 5 years. I'm good at coding and good at interviewing. I'm good at ML. But I failed most of the few interviews I did have.

Title: Very interesting article for those who studied computer science, computer science jobs are drying up in the United States for two reasons one you can pay an Indian $25,000 for what an American wants 300K for, 2) automation. Oh and investors are tired of fraud 
Body: 
Comment: As a person who worked in it development (as a manager) I'll tell you that what ever you save in development cost by offshoring to India (or elsewhere), you'll pay extra in design costs. Because your designs need to be twice as thick and very highly specified. Otherwise the deliverables will be near useless. You also need more iterations to get to a useful deliverable. 

This is because, Offshore, people just don't have the culture context to understand certain things that might just seem so plain an common to a westerner. The way we write addresses or names, our local regulations, tax specifications, business processes. 

As an example: You ask for a field to register an address, and they'll give you just that. 1 field, to write in an address. They don't think to separate number and street, city and postal code. You'll have to write out how these are formatted usually. The more complex the subject matter, the more you‚Äôll run into these issues. 

And I haven't event mentioned all the cultural issues in international cooperation. Like for example indians always saying yes, because you're the issuer. Even if they don't understand the assignment. Deliver next week? Yes! They'll deliver something but not what you wanted or needed.

You also need around twice the number of developers to iron out these inefficiencies.

I worked with indians offshore for 10 years.
Comment: I assure you, you cannot get $300k of American developer quality for $25k of offshore development. Ask anyone experienced in this process.
Comment: Where did you get the "Oh and investors are tired of fraud".
Comment: This is quite interesting. I am not a SWE but I have worked in quite a few software companies, and I know quite a few SWEs.  All of my friends are OK (for now), but I follow Hacker News and I see the stats where after FAANG & Co's layoffs people are having trouble finding employment / equivalent salaries.

And this has happened somewhat overnight, in about 1 year or so.
Comment: My team just offshored our developers to India at a rate of 1 US worker to 2.5 India workers. 

6 months later and we have probably gotten two sprints of actual quality work. The knowledge transfer, time zone issues and communication difficulties just add more friction than it‚Äôs worth in my opinion.
Comment: What‚Äôs with the weird tone in the title.

Also this is very old news, jobs have been offshored for more than 20 years.
Comment: Last decade of tech has been largely useless. Web3 blockchain scams, apps nobody wants, saas nobody wants, and security flaws across every major industry. It mostly just exists now for private equity to put a bow on top of an effective method to steal our data, invade our privacy, and exploit us. Now they‚Äôre going to automate away any chance for our middle class.
Comment: I can‚Äôt see the whole article because it‚Äôs paywalled. Is there actually data to back up ‚Äútech jobs are drying up‚Äù, or is this just anecdotal?
Comment: It's always about the Benjamins... It's never about the Benimadhavans.üòû
Comment: Do you think this is the first time companies discover offshoring? Spoiler alert, it's not, in fact this is a semi-regular phenomena now. 

There are problems with offshoring these managers and CEOs will discover, and the ironic thing is that they are not new problems, they were discovered by other CEOs before them, maybe/often from the exact same companies.

Comment: How do we know he actually said that?
Comment: The solution is to cryptographically sign genuine recordings. Surely something can be implemented that verifies the origin of images, sound and video.

The idea that AI should be stamped us pointless as it relates on compliance.

- sama, et al.
Comment: Elon is such a fake person
Comment: So, Elon sued OpenAI for becoming a de facto for profit entity when he agreed that it needed to become exactly that.

What the fuck.
Comment: ChatGPT summary:

> Elon is bad.

Just kidding.

> Building AGI required more resources than anticipated, leading to the initial suggestion of a $1B funding commitment. Despite raising significant funds, OpenAI realized the need for billions annually, far exceeding initial expectations. Discussions about a for-profit entity arose due to the massive capital requirements, but disagreements with Elon Musk about control led to his departure from OpenAI. Despite these challenges, OpenAI continued its mission to develop and make AI tools widely available, benefiting various sectors globally. The mission emphasized broad access over open-sourcing the technology, aligning with the goal of benefiting everyone from AI advancements.

TL; DR quote:

> We all understood we were going to need a lot more capital to succeed at our mission‚Äîbillions of dollars per year, which was far more than any of us, especially Elon, thought we‚Äôd be able to raise as the non-profit.
Comment: Elon is such a fucking tool.

Body: 
Comment: And the turns have tabled.
Comment: Cool chess moves between the investors of OpenAI.
Comment: Smart move by Microsoft to hire them. But I will be curious to see how long Sam and Greg last?

It is going to be completely different for them. They are not going to have anywhere near the autonomy they enjoyed at OpenAI.

But this entire episode is a bit mind blowing.

One thing I find interesting is that Alphabet had two AI competitors. Cruise and OpenAI.

Both companies look to have self destructed. Cruise CEO resigned over the weekend.

In both cases it looks like it was about safety. AI is so different from other technologies.

There is such a huge safety aspect. It could be we will see a lot of stuff like this. Where people with AI thought they could move fast and break things and found out they really could not that someone is watching and not going to let them.

Comment: How is this going to be a good thing? Microsoft out of all companies?  Unless Microsoft has made a breakthrough that Altman and Brockman see will consume everything else. Little worried about that coming from Microsoft.

Title: AI Has Made Google Search So Bad People Are Moving to TikTok and Reddit
Body: - Google search results are filled with low-quality AI content, prompting users to turn to platforms like TikTok and Reddit for answers.

- SEO optimization, the skill of making content rank high on Google, has become crucial.

- AI has disrupted the search engine ranking system, causing Google to struggle against spam content.

- Users are now relying on human interaction on TikTok and Reddit for accurate information.

- Google must balance providing relevant results and generating revenue to stay competitive.

Comment: No, google has made their search so bad that people are moving almost everywhere (except bing)

AI didn't kill search, Google killed it themselves with ranking click farms, listicles and ads above the good stuff
Comment: I started adding ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù to the end of every Google search for about the last 6 months or so, as AI and ads have become endemic and polluted the results.
Comment: I've used reddit as my Google search for almost a decade at this point.
Comment: A Medium article written by‚Ä¶ who?

I don‚Äôt discount the hypothesis but this is hardly a credible source.
Comment: Uh this is why I search Reddit using [thegigabrain.com](https://thegigabrain.com) now
Comment: Google brought back the FORUM filter!


That's the only upside of this¬†
Comment: use 'before:2022' in all searches, it's the only way. Not helpful for news and looking for current info, but it's still useful for other stuff.
Comment: Have to say I'm very disappointed with Google search but it began before AI was a thing. So much useless paid content, I couldn't even find a clinic near my home on Google Maps because they did not advertise. Try to find honest critical reviews about a hit TV show and you get a deluge of payola articles singing its praises even if you specifically searched for more scathing reviews. It's absurd but hey no successful company lasts forever, if Google continues down this path one day the term to "google something" may be all that's left of them, similar to how we might still say we'll "tape something" even though we've long moved past video/cassette tapes.
Comment: I add reddit to the end of most of my Google searches, I find the reddit search function so bad but it has the answer to 90% of my questions.
Comment: Interestingly AI has replaced google as the way to search for answers to programming questions. I will only use google if I don't get good answers from the AI but that is slowly changing as the AI improves. Googles search results getting worse influences this shift as well

AI in the media is rife with jargon and facile 'experts'. Spend decades actually doing AI research, then maybe call yourself an AI expert. Even then, have Feynman's words ringing in your ears.


In fairness of course, Hawking and Musk would never describe themselves as AI experts. That's especially true now for Hawking, sadly.

Never mind Siraj Raval though since he's out there just to create hype.
Comment: Personally I'm more concerned about the big countries who are sinking tonnes of money into AI research for killer bots.

Of course, I don't see any solution to the alignment problem (or orthogonality argument), the AI will surely have slightly different goals to us, act so that it can complete those goals and therefore remove any obstacles (such as us) to ensure that it completes those goals without hindrance.

I don't see any way to avoid that.

Right ones obviously fake, pole doesnt reach the ground, camera not reacting to car lights, it preserves too much detail in compression, cars driving down middle of the road, street lines are over edged while lacking wear.

Also these are badly compressed to the point that alot can be hidden, bad test.

Comment: Its a trick question, they're both AI generated.

Indicators Left: Zoom in on the stripes in the middle they have weird artefacts squiggling around, and are literally merging into one large line, left part of the road goes seamless into the dark (The road literally vanishes), typical tree weirdness in the upper left part of the image

Indicator Right: Clear break in the lines in the middle, pole without line (And it is not really symmetrical, it looks like an inbetween something of a power pole and a tree), too much detail for a very foggy scenario

Indicator that both are made with the same tool: When you look at the fog, the gradient work from dark to light is pretty much the same work process, with clearly seperated lines going shapes darker,

Comment: I'm more worried about my fellow humans' reaction to life's inconveniences than I am about an AI superintelligence.

Comment: Ai determines human existence is the cause of all human suffering.   Uhoh
Comment: If he thinks we only have 4 years left, in 4 years time can I say that I'm smarter than a nobel prize winner?

Comment: Pretty much covers the range from "Yes Please!" to "Hell No!". Automation handling driving and maintenance so Mom and Dad can be the one playing cards sitting down for a meal with their kids \[1\]. 

Using bots for military and civil take-downs.. No thanks. 

The second one really made me think. We were a "sit down together for a meal" kind of family, but what that usually meant was "everyone but Mom sit down for the meal while Mom keeps hoping up to take care of the next thing on the stove or starts on the dishes."
Comment: The peoples' blissful faces with the corpse 5 feet away in the 4th one is hilarious.
Comment: This is really good! I love the "... and we'll just rest!" part, like it feels so 80s.
Comment: I love how the military robot is either floating or mid jump
Comment: verhoevenesque üåü
Comment: Amazing work I absolutely love these!!!!!
Comment: Why do robots have taste buds? Other then that, military is terrifying and the final one is hilarious but also terrifying
Comment: I like how the robot soldier really seems to have a high morale.

Comment: We gonna DIY the police state
Comment: Im not having a go at OP because if it wasnt him then someone else would have developed it.

"Its about safety" so fuck peoples right to anonymity, there is no pressing need. They arent very good security if they arent watching people as they come in.

This is a solution looking for a problem and absolutely will be used by tyrants in protests etc so the protestors can be found if neccessary. 

 Just like we have rights to our own likeness we need to have rights to our own biometrics and the right to NOT have biometrics stored without consent.
Comment: An expectation of visibility? Faced with surveillance capitalism, no one should be expected to be wholly visible and identifiable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about promoting safety and a positive customer experience, not surveillance for its own sake‚Äù and yet it‚Äôs literally biometric tracking
Comment: I roll my eyes at how fucking transparent the "It's for safety reasons" is.
Comment: This is why engineers should be required to take humanities courses.
Comment: Cool work, can‚Äôt help but then think this‚Äôll be used to make mores targeted ads tho.
Comment: Thank you for reminding me where I draw the line in what I produce for clients.
Comment: Can't even be a weirdo anymore.
Comment: These models already exist and are open source . If your worries about it being use for surveillance, just remember for it to be used in the public, it would need to be useful from 50 to 100 feet away, something these models aren‚Äôt good at. Sitting in front of your PC with a high res webcam isn‚Äôt realistic for tracking people.

Comment: looks like a dmt trip lol
Comment: I'll have what he's having
Comment: Sweet! You should look into NFT or crypto art. It is a way to make digital art works an asset that can be acquired by art collectors or displayed in virtual galleries. I recently minted a token for one of my pieces of generative art. It was more expensive than I anticipated and annoyingly complicated, but I persevered and got it done. I think it was worthwhile to learn the process.
Comment: Would you care to elaborate on your methodology and/or you have a git you wanna share? This is awesome and I'd love to learn what kind of data processing pipelines your using. I have never really ventured into computer vision work.

Comment: This took me a second read, then I laughed. lol. 
Comment: Haha! Nice! 
Comment: It's just for showing how close you reach when you predict a data which is being tested into the machines and delivers the great outcome. If you have heard the name "Approximations" & "Round-off" they are also one and the same things!  
Comment: It's regressive
Comment: but why would an interviewer ask addition in an interview.
Comment: Because in ML, you try to reach closure and closure to the actual simulation and when the machine starts responding the way we wanted, it becomes a prototype
